It would probably be safe to assume that this data does not represent typical drivers at large. Perhaps the data&mdash;and in particular the sample of churned users&mdash;contains a high proportion of long-haul truckers.\n\nIn consideration of how much these users drive, it would be worthwhile to recommend to Waze that they gather more data on these super-drivers. It's possible that the reason for their driving so much is also the reason why the Waze app does not meet their specific set of needs, which may differ from the needs of a more typical driver, such as a commuter.","metadata":{"id":"LVRAwsb1nv2L"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Finally, examine whether there is an imbalance in how many users churned by device type.\n\nBegin by getting the overall counts of each device type for each group, churned and retained.","metadata":{"id":"xc7Q6elLoD1R"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# For each label, calculate the number of Android users and iPhone users\n# For retained users\nuser_ret = df[mask_ret]['device'].value_counts()\nuser_ret\n","metadata":{"id":"LGkODIILoEp-","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.916164Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.916868Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.932706Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.916814Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.931401Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# For churned users\nuser_chu = df[mask_chu]['device'].value_counts()\nuser_chu\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.937135Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.937919Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.94921Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.937882Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.948029Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, within each group, churned and retained, calculate what percent was Android and what percent was iPhone.","metadata":{"id":"yTVM6qFkoJs4"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# For each label, calculate the percentage of Android users and iPhone users\nprint('For Retained users, % of iPhone is ', f\"{round(100*user_ret[0] / (user_ret[0]+user_ret[1]), 2)} %\")\nprint('For Retained users, % of Android is ', f\"{round(100*user_ret[1] / (user_ret[0]+user_ret[1]), 2)} %\")\n\nprint('For Churned users, % of iPhone is ', f\"{round(100*user_chu[0] / (user_chu[0]+user_chu[1]), 2)} %\")\nprint('For Churned users, % of Android is ', f\"{round(100*user_chu[1] / (user_chu[0]+user_chu[1]), 2)} %\")\n","metadata":{"id":"rx0ElsS6oO7y","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.950857Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.951679Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.958815Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.951644Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-05T22:14:25.95797Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The ratio of iPhone users and Android users is consistent between the churned group and the retained group, and those ratios are both consistent with the ratio found in the overall dataset.","metadata":{"id":"DQVIMPzroavO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"images/Construct.png\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" align=left>\n\n## **PACE: Construct**\n\n**Note**: The Construct stage does not apply to this workflow.

Conclusion**\n\nRecall that your supervisor, May Santer, asked you to share your findings with the data team in an executive summary. Consider the following questions as you prepare to write your summary. Think about key points you may want to share with the team, and what information is most relevant to the user churn project.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Did the data contain any missing values? How many, and which variables were affected? Was there a pattern to the missing data?\n\n2. What is a benefit of using the median value of a sample instead of the mean?\n\n3. Did your investigation give rise to further questions that you would like to explore or ask the Waze team about?\n\n4. What percentage of the users in the dataset were Android users and what percentage were iPhone users?\n\n5. What were some distinguishing characteristics of users who churned vs. users who were retained?\n\n6. Was there an appreciable difference in churn rate between iPhone users vs. Android users?\n\n\n\n","metadata":{"id":"u3HxcMZgz6iW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1. Did the data contain any missing values? How many, and which variables were affected? Was there a pattern to the missing data?\nYes, the label column is missing 700 values. \n\n2. What is a benefit of using the median value of a sample instead of the mean?\nThe benefit of using the median and not the mean is that outliers would not unduly affect the portrayal of a typical user. \n\n3. Did your investigation give rise to further questions that you would like to explore or ask the Waze team about?\nThe distance per drive and per day for churned customers are a lot greater than retained customers. In consideration of how much these users drive, it would be worthwhile to recommend to Waze that they gather more data on these super-drivers. It's possible that the reason for their driving so much is also the reason why the Waze app does not meet their specific set of needs, which may differ from the needs of a more typical driver, such as a commuter.\n\n4. What percentage of the users in the dataset were Android users and what percentage were iPhone users?\n% of iPhone is  64.48 %\n% of Android is  35.52 %\n\n5. What were some distinguishing characteristics of users who churned vs. users who were retained?\nThe data suggests that churned users had more drives in fewer days, and their trips were farther and longer in duration. Perhaps this is suggestive of a user profile. \n\n6. Was there an appreciable difference in churn rate between iPhone users vs. Android users?\nThe ratio of iPhone users and Android users is consistent between the churned group and the retained group, and those ratios are both consistent with the ratio found in the overall dataset.\n","metadata":{"id":"iMHlK7k5_2PV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Congratulations!** You've completed this lab.
