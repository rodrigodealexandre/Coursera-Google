    "# Course 3 end-of-course portfolio project overview: Waze\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learn about the Course 3 Waze workplace scenario!\n",
    "\n",
    "The end-of-course project in Course 3 focuses on your ability to use exploratory data analysis to organize and understand the data within a project. As a reminder, in Course 1 you developed a project proposal that outlined milestones, which progress with each of the end-of-course projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background on the Waze scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll collaborate with your Waze teammates to analyze and interpret data, generate valuable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions. Your team is about to start a new project to help prevent user churn on the Waze app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Who are the users most likely to churn?\n",
    "- Why do users churn?\n",
    "- When do users churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project background\n",
    "\n",
    "Waze’s data team is working on the churn project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:\n",
    "- EDA and cleaning\n",
    "- Select and build visualization(s) type\n",
    "  - Create plots to visualize variables and relationships between variables\n",
    "- Share your results with the data team\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "You will conduct exploratory data analysis on data for the churn project and use tools to create visuals for an executive summary to help non-technical stakeholders engage and interact with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Team members at Waze\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data team roles\n",
    "- Harriet Hadzic - Director of Data Analysis\n",
    "- May Santner - Data Analysis Manager\n",
    "- Chidi Ga - Senior Data Analyst\n",
    "- Sylvester Esperanza - Senior Project Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "Data team members have technical experience with data analysis and data science. However, you should always keep summaries and messages to these team members concise and to the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-functional team members\n",
    "- Emrick Larson - Finance and Administration Department Head\n",
    "- Ursula Sayo - Operations Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Waze team includes several managers overseeing operations. It is important to adapt your communication to their roles since their responsibilities are less technical.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: The story and all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this project are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased) is intended or should be inferred.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specific project deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "With this end-of-course project, you will gain valuable practice and apply your new skills as you complete the following:\n",
    "- Complete the questions in the Course 3 PACE strategy document\n",
    "- Answer the questions in the Jupyter notebook project file\n",
    "- Clean your data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Create data visualizations\n",
    "- Create an executive summary to share your results\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck with this project! Your Waze team members are looking forward to seeing how you communicate your creative work and approach problem-solving!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate end-of-course project is designed for you to practice and apply course skills in a fictional workplace scenario. By completing each course’s end-of-course project, you will have work examples that will enhance your portfolio and showcase your skills for future employers.\n"

    "## Activity Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will showcase your ability to use statistical methods to analyze and interpret data. In particular, you will compute descriptive statistics and conduct a hypothesis test. You will also update team members and stakeholders through an executive summary, demonstrating your ability to organize and communicate key information.\n",

    "\n",
    "Your Waze team is nearing the midpoint of their project to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. So far, you’ve completed a project proposal, and used Python to explore and analyze Waze’s user data. You’ve also used Python to create data visualizations. The next step is to use statistical methods to analyze and interpret your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You receive a new email from Sylvester Esperanza, your project manager. Sylvester tells your team about a new request from leadership: to analyze the relationship between mean amount of rides and device type. You also discover follow-up emails from three other team members: May Santner, Chidi Ga, and Harriet Hadzic. These emails discuss the details of the analysis. A final email from Chidi includes your specific assignment: to conduct a two-sample hypothesis test.\n",
