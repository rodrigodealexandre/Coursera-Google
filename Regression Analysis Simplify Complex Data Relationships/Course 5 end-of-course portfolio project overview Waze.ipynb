    "## Activity Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will showcase your ability to use Python to build a multiple linear regression (MLR) model. You will also update team members and stakeholders through an executive summary, demonstrating your ability to organize and communicate key information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional information on how to complete this activity, review the previous readings: [End-of-course project introduction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-data-science/supplement/9Opfe/end-of-course-portfolio-project-introduction) and [Course 5 end-of-course portfolio project overview: Waze](https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-analysis-simplify-complex-data-relationships/supplement/dPJfW/course-5-end-of-course-portfolio-project-overview-waze).\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with completed exemplars to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplars until you have completed this activity.\n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "The data team at Waze is more than halfway through their project for developing a machine learning model to predict user churn. Earlier, you completed a project proposal, used Python to explore and analyze Waze’s user data, created data visualizations, and conducted a hypothesis test. Now, leadership wants your team to build a regression model to predict user churn based on a variety of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You check your inbox and discover a new email from Ursula Sayo, the Operations Manager at Waze. Ursula asks your team about the details of the regression model. You also notice two follow-up emails from your supervisor, May Santner. The first email is a response to Ursula, and says that the team will build a binomial logistic regression model. In her second email, May asks you to help build the model and prepare an executive summary to share your results.\n",
