This project is part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone. The goal is to develop a predictive model to identify employees at risk of leaving Salifort Motors. The web application showcases the model and its predictions.

Furthermore, for the conclusion of the project, there are also two files: one [Word](https://github.com/rodrigodealexandre/Coursera-Google/blob/main/7%20-%20Google%20Advanced%20Data%20Analytics%20Capstone/Filled_Course-7-PACE-strategy-document.docx) and one [PowerPoint](https://github.com/rodrigodealexandre/Coursera-Google/blob/main/7%20-%20Google%20Advanced%20Data%20Analytics%20Capstone/Filled_Executive-summaries.pptx).

#### Overview

##### What We Learned

Throughout the Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone, we focused on several key areas:

- **Project Proposal Creation**: We learned how to outline the objectives, scope, and deliverables of a data analytics project.
- **Understanding Python**: We demonstrated our understanding of Python's form and function, leveraging it to load, explore, extract, and organize information through custom functions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We used Jupyter notebooks to perform EDA, identifying patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data.
- **Visualization with Tableau**: We created visualizations to effectively communicate data insights.
- **Statistical Analysis**: We computed descriptive statistics and conducted hypothesis tests using Python.
- **Model Building**: We built a multiple linear regression model with ANOVA testing and evaluated its performance.
- **Machine Learning**: We created a series of machine learning models to solve the problem of predicting employee turnover.
- **Executive Summary**: We articulated our findings in an executive summary for external stakeholders.

##### Project Implementation

- **Data Collection**: Historical employee data was gathered and cleaned for analysis.
- **EDA**: We performed exploratory data analysis to understand data distributions and identify key features.
- **Model Development**: Predictive models were trained and evaluated to identify at-risk employees.
- **Model Validation**: We validated the model performance using cross-validation and out-of-sample testing.
- **Deployment**: The final model was deployed as a web application using Flask.

#### Combining Knowledge

To conclude this course, I combined the knowledge gained from the Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone with skills acquired from the IBM AI Developer Professional Certificate. While I did not learn Flask, HTML, or CSS in the Google course, these skills were essential for developing and deploying the web application.

#### Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical application of advanced data analytics techniques to solve a real-world business problem. The combination of predictive modeling and web application development showcases the integration of multiple skills and knowledge areas.
