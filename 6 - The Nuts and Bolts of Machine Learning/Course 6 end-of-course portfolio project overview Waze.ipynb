    "## Activity Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will showcase your ability to use Python to build classification models. You will also update team members and stakeholders through an executive summary, demonstrating your ability to organize and communicate key information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional information on how to complete this activity, review the previous readings: [End-of-course project introduction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-data-science/supplement/9Opfe/end-of-course-portfolio-project-introduction) and [Course 6 end-of-course portfolio project overview: Waze](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-nuts-and-bolts-of-machine-learning/supplement/gAk77/course-6-end-of-course-portfolio-project-overview-waze).\n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team at Waze is close to completing their project for developing a machine learning model to predict user churn. Previously, you completed a project proposal, and used Python to explore and analyze Waze’s user data, create data visualizations, and conduct a hypothesis test. Most recently, you built a binomial logistic regression model based on a variety of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leadership appreciates all your hard work. Now, they want your team to build and test different machine learning models to predict user churn. Your work will help leadership make informed business decisions to prevent user churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a meeting with project stakeholders, your team suggests building and testing the following machine learning models: random forest and XGBoost. At the end of the meeting, the Operations Manager says that he will share the suggestion with leadership.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few days after the meeting, you receive an email from Emrick Larson, Waze’s Finance and Administration Department Head. Emrick says that leadership likes the idea of building and testing the two models to predict user churn, and asks the team to share more details about the models. You also receive a follow-up email from Harriet Hadzic, the Director of Data Analysis. Harriet asks you to build the two models, and prepare an executive summary to share your results.\n",

    "Thank you for providing the details for the final phase of the prediction algorithm we have requested. I apologize for missing many of the weekly project meetings, but I’ve been keeping informed of your progress. We discussed in detail your proposal for building and testing the following models for prediction: random forest and XGBoost. We agree with this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please go ahead with the creation of the algorithm. It would be very helpful if you could share what data indicators the algorithm is based on, and describe the confidence your team has in the model performance.\n",
